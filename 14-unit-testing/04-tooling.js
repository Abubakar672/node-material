// to write test we need a test framework. a test framework gives us a library that includes a bunch of utility functions and use these utility functions to write tests. it also gives us a test runner which is actually a program that is run through a command line. and this runs our tests and gives us report that how many tests have passed or failed
// there are several frameworks on this base the most popular are 
// Jasmine, Mocha, Jest
// we'll use Jest

// focus on the fundamentals not the tooling
