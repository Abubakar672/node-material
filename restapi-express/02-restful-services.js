// here we'll discuss briefly about the restful services. these are also called restful apis.
// most of the apps use client server architecture. App  is itself a client and under the hood it talks with the server to get or save the data.
// this comunication happens with the HTTP communication protocol. this protocol powers our web. on the server we expose a lot of services that are accessible via the http prtocol. the client can directly call these services by sending the HTTP requests.
// this is where REST(Representational State Transfer) comes to the picture, REST is a convention to build these HTTP services.
// so we use simple http protocol principle to provide support to Create, Read , Update and Delete Data. we reffer to these as CRUD Operations.
